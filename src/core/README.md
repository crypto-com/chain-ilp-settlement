# Settlement Core

> ### Framework for building Interledger settlement engines in JavaScript

## Design Goals

- **Isomorphic**. JavaScript settlement engines should operate seamlessly across Node.js, desktop & mobile browsers, and Electron.
- **Interoperable**. Settlement engines should fully support each next-generation connector, including [Interledger.rs](https://github.com/interledger-rs/interledger-rs), [Rafiki](https://github.com/interledgerjs/rafiki), and the [Java connector](https://github.com/sappenin/java-ilpv4-connector/).
- **Accessible**. Provide the essential primitives to quickly develop safe, reliable settlement engine implementations.
- **Modular**. TODO
- **Scalable**. Support standalone clients all the way up to high-volume, low-latency service providers.

## Prerequisites

Before building a settlement engine, [please read the Settlement Engine RFC](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/76c717604ee8d51d8f61a9bc2cb92ba135738f09/0000-settlement-engines/0000-settlement-engines.md).

## API

TODO Add some docs here to explain how to do this

TODO Update RFC link after publish

TODO ðŸš¨that this is beta and subject to change
